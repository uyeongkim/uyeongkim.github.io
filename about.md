  - Summary: Our paper introduces the CPEM (Context-aware Planner and Environment-aware Memory) embodied agent, revolutionizing AI agents' ability to perform household tasks. CPEM's unique approach to integrating contextual data and maintaining updated spatial object arrangements results in significantly enhanced visual navigation and object interaction capabilities. This method has shown exceptional improvements in task success across various challenging benchmarks, particularly in new and unfamiliar environments.
